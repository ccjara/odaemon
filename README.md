OGame RSS Spy Notificator [GER]

I decided to push this private project here since RSS feed is being removed from OGame as of version 6 on the Friday 20th of November, 2015.
This is my first C# application and it basically just retrieves the RSS feed in configurable intervals from your account and then warns you if you are being spied anywhere. That way you can idle in your account and do other stuff on the computer while still being aware what is going on in the game. It was a very useful tool to me and my friends I shared it with but since the RSS feed is about to get removed this tool shares no purpose anymore.

Since it was just a private small project the localisation of it is German, but the comments and the source itself is of course in English.

I will pick up on it again in case the RSS-Feed gets reintroduced again.
